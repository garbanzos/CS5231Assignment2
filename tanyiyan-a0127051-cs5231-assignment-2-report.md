## Task 0
### Differences between Android VM and actual Android devices
One difference between them is the recovery OSes installed on them. An actual Android device's recovery OS is the recovery OS placed by vendor. This recovery OS placed by the vendor does not give users a shell prompt so users are unable to run arbitrary commands. Furthermore, the recovery OS placed by the vendor only accepts OTA packages signed by the vendor. In contrast, the Android VM has a general-purpose OS installed as the "recovery OS" - Ubuntu 15.10 is installed as the "recovery OS". To simulate what an actual recovery OS does when installing an OTA update, a recovery program (Neko Android) is installed on the recovery OS. This recovery program allows users access to both a normal user shell and a root shell so users are able to run arbitrary commands and make arbitrary changes to the Android partition. Moreover, the recovery program in the Android VM also allows users to disable digital signature verification of the OTA packages - this functionality is not available in the recovery OS of an actual Android device.

Another difference is location where the `rc` script files imported by `init.rc` are stored. In an actual Android device, these script files are inside `boot.img`, which contains `ramdisk.img` and the kernel. On the other hand, these
script files are are stored in the `ramdisk.img` image file on the Android VM.

In addition, the state of the bootloader may also be different. In an actual Android device, the bootloader is usually "locked". With a locked bootloader, any attempt to flash the installed OS will be denied by the bootloader. The manufacturers may or may not choose to permanently lock the bootloader so the bootloader cannot be unlocked with normal means. For the lab, it is assumed that the bootloader on the Android VM can be unlocked and it was "unlocked" at some point to replace the stock recovery OS with Ubuntu 15.10.

## Task 1

### Problematic component of signature verification process

Usually in an actual Android device, the OTA update package is verified twice before installing the package:
1. The OTA package is verified by the main system using the `RecoverySystem.verifyPackage()` method in the Android API. This method checks the signature of the OTA package against the public keys stored in the main system, in the file `/system/etc/security/otacerts.zip`.
2. The OTA package is verified by the recovery OS. The recovery OS checks the signature of the OTA package against the public keys stored in the recovery partition RAM disk, in the file `/res/keys`.

On our Android VM, it seems that OTA package was not checked twice. The recovery did not check the signature of my OTA package against the public keys stored in `/res/keys`. As a result, in order to make the Android VM accept my OTA package signed with my private key, it suffices to change the `/system/etc/security/otacerts.zip` in the main system to include my public key.

### Verifying our custom OTA file

In order to make the OTA update service accept my custom OTA file, I generated my own set of public and private keys using `openssl` and signed my OTA package using `signapk.jar` that was provided in the Android VM. Next, I created a `otacerts.zip` file that contains my public key. Then, I replaced the `/system/etc/security/otacerts.zip` in the main Android system with the `otacerts.zip` that I created using `scp.` It seems that `scp` has excessive privileges on the Android OS as it is able to copy files into `/android/system/etc/security/` directory that can only be written to by a process with root privileges, as seen in Figure 1.

Finally, I copied my signed OTA package into the recovery OS and flashed my OTA package using the recovery program. As seen in Figure 2., the signature verification succeeded. After rebooting my Android VM, the `dummy` file is found n the `\system` directory (Shown in Figure. 4).

### Differences between the dummy files created in Task 1 and 2

One difference between the dummy files created in Task 1 and 2 is when they are created. In task 1, the `dummy` file is created when the file `/system/etc/init.sh` is executed. In the `init.sh`, a command to run `dummy.sh` was added by me (via the OTA's update-binary using `sed`) and when this command to run `dummy.sh` is executed, the `dummy` file is created. On the other hand, the `dummy2` file is created when my wrapper program for `app_process` is executed (when the Android OS bootstraps its runtime). The wrapper program creates the `dummy2` file and then invokes the original `app_process` (which was renamed to `app_process_original`).

Another difference between the dummy files is their permissions. For `dummy` that is created in task 1, the permissions is `-rw-rw-rw-`, as seen in Figure 4. In contrast, the permissions for `dummy2` in task 2 is `-rw-------`, as seen in Figure 6.

In addition, one trivial difference between the dummy files is their contents. `dummy` in task 1 contains "hello" whereas `dummy2` in task 2 is an empty file.

## Task 3

### The root shell

After starting the client program `mysu`, the root shell is obtained. This can be seen in Figure 7. below.

*Figure 7. The root shell obtained in task 3*

### File descriptors of the client and shell processes

Figure 8. and Figure 9. shows the `/proc/<PID>/fd` of the client and the shell processes respectively. As seen in the figures, all the file descriptors point to `/dev/pts/0`.
